        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a fundamental language used to create and structure content on the World Wide Web.</li>
          <li>It employs tags to define elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, and images, enabling web browsers to render and display web pages as intended by developers.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a crucial web technology that complements HTML by controlling the visual presentation of web pages. </li>
          <li>With CSS, designers can apply styles like colors, fonts, spacing, and layout to HTML elements, ensuring a consistent and appealing user experience across various devices and screen sizes. </li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is a distributed version control system widely used by developers to manage and track changes in their codebase. </li>
          <li>With Git, developers can create repositories to store their code, enabling them to collaborate with others, track changes over time, and easily revert to previous versions when necessary. </li>
          <li>Git utilizes a branching model, allowing developers to work on separate features or bug fixes in isolated branches and merge them back into the main codebase when they are ready.</li>
          <li>Git services like GitHub and GitLab provide hosting solutions that enhance collaboration and enable developers to share their code with a broader community.</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>

          <li>JavaScript is a versatile and widely-used programming language that is primarily employed for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites.</li>
          <li>It runs in web browsers, allowing developers to create interactive web applications, handle user input, and modify the content of web pages in real-time, making it a fundamental component of modern web development. </li>
